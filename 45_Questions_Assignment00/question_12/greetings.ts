//               QUESTION:12
/*
Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
 print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
 but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
*/

// Define an array called names 
let names: string[] = ["Alixa", "Ali", "Shaheed", "Manahil"];

//forEach method
names.forEach(friends => {
    
    //print a message to them.
    console.log(`Hello ${friends}, "whould you like to learn some typescript !"`);
    });
